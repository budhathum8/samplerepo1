In this introduction to ChatGPT, you’ll learn how large language models are used to build generative AI tools and the different things you can create with generative AI. Then, you’ll see how you can use ChatGPT at work and in your personal life to save time and effort (and have more fun!). We’ll also go over the basics of prompt engineering — writing instructions for generative AI. Plus, now you can build your prompt engineering skills and get hands-on experience writing, testing, and refining prompts directly in the course
